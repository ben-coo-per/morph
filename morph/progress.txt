improve rotation:
  maybe just do only around the y axis?

fiddle around with vertex shape creation:
  toruses are great but cant give flexibility















5. add a ‘sculpting’/‘shaping’ tool               |                         |
    -> push around and place the pre-drawn curves how you like
6. make wireframe of UI                           |                         |
    -> change button & slider styles
    -> make corners rounder
    -> fit to Bootstrap or follow design guide saved in Chrome bookmarks?
7. Build UI                                       |                         |
    -> build studio
    -> publish
        ->integrate w/ shopify or host w/ other provider & build yourself?
    -> get feedback
        -> subreddits like r/sideProject, r/ABTesting, roastmystartup, etc.
    -> then build 'standard shopping method'
    -> publish standard mix&match
    -> set up collection of user behavior metrics
        -> what questions need to answer?
          1. what channel do people prefer?
            a. % conversion of people Studio -> sale?
            b. % conversion of people Traditional -> sale?
            c. % of users who visit:
                  - Studio site
                    > how much time do they spend in the Studio?
                  - Traditional shop site
                  - both
                    > what % start in Studio and buy from Traditional?
                    > what % start in Traditional and buy from Studio?
                    > what % don't buy at all?
                    > what % buy from both?
            e. avg # of items in order?

          2. what should we focus on next?
            - survey after checkout?
            - survey for discount/free shipping offer right as someone adds something to cart?

              a. how is the experience with the Studio?
                  - "Tell us how you're feeling about your experience"
              b. how is the experience with the Traditional?
                  - "Tell us how you're feeling about your experience"
              c. what other options should be available for customization on products?
              d. what other products would you like to see in the Store?








Features to Add:
  easy:
    checkbox for showing mirror

  medium:
    add an ‘eraser’ tool                              |///                      |
        —> use the push/pop for objects out of the array in order to erase
        -> Do not just paint over it*
    event logger -> ability to undo last move

  hard:
    rotation amount selection/type
    find way to export svg file of sketch*

  hardest:
    build out export as obj/stl file functionality for P5 -> contribute this back to the project

  benched:
    make 'object-logging' speed faster             |                         |
        -> this might be as easy as setting the refresh rate on the p5.js draw function lower
    add autofill lines                             |-------not needed?------|
      -> how close is circle[i] to circle [i+1]? (call it d)
          > if (d < toleranceMin || d > toleranceMax){do nothing}
                a. if distance is greater than max-fill-tolerance: ignore
                b. if distance is less than min-fill-tolerance: ignore
          > if (d > toleranceMin && d < toleranceMax){ add additional circles between those 2 circles}
                a. if distance is greater than min-fill-tolerance & less than max-fill-tolerance, add in circle
                b. add circle at circle[i+1] index and shift everything (starting from original circle[i+1]) 1 index over.
