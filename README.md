# morph


This was my first attempt at P5.js so be kind :)

online product studio.

the original goal was to create a space where people can create pots, dishes, home d√©cor, and, eventually, furniture with the flexibility and usability to help them create great-looking, custom designs without spending hours perfecting their skills with a tool.

It didn't really go that far...
It became a fun thing to create weird shapes with but I have moved on to other things and do not anticipate spending time on this to build it into something decent.
