online product studio.

the goal is to create a space where people can create pots, dishes, home décor, and, eventually, furniture with the flexibility and usability to help them create great-looking, custom designs without spending hours perfecting their skills with a tool.

i believe there will always be a place for craftspeople and designers, this is not an attempt to replace them, but rather an attempt to inspire people to see the value in custom furniture and home décor in the hopes that, if given a low cost entry, people will begin to add more one-of-a-kind furniture pieces to their homes rather than buying a cheap, mass-manufactured piece from a big box store.
